# libcontainers packages for Ubuntu 18.04

This repository hosts old versions of various libcontainers packages that are
compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. These packages were previously available from the
[openSUSE Build Service](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/xUbuntu_18.04/),
but old versions of software are routinely deleted from that mirror.
